During Passion Week, Ancient Greek Anique was detained after a government worker let out a shriek. They were full of pique with her name. They were reviewing official documents and were bewildered by her name, thinking it to be the opposite of chic. Officials were pouring out critique, pointing out the nameâ€™s mystique, so to speak. Anique claims that her unique name was an antique passed on from the Greek, but the police found it to be a weak excuse for its oblique nature. We sentence this lawbreaker to a workweek.
