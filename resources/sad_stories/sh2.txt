The floods plaguing the city have been put to an end after the capture of Korean Drama Sarah. Every day, she was binging K-dramas, crying out torrents and torrents of tears. They managed to build up and permeate the entire city, causing problems everywhere. We sentence this crook to community service at the hydropower plant in order to assist the city with reconstruction.
