Hiding Dracula Angela was put behind bars after being captured inside of her room after missing school for weeks. We had always thought she was hiding away because of the sun, but it turned out that it was because she is always sick. As a result of her isolation, her room was quite rancid. Angela was arrested for perpetual sickness. We sentence this baddie to a month of solitary confinement.
