This just in, Vitamin C Kathy has been caught in the act of pillaging local markets of their oranges. She had been participating in a competition to see who could last the longest without getting sick. Kathy had been in the finals, but after being caught with a barrel of oranges, she has been disqualified. Apparently she was using the oranges to gain an unfair edge in the competition the whole time. We sentence this culprit to a doctorâ€™s appointment out of spite.
