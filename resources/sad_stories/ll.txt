Boba Tea Lucy has been jailed for going to all of the boba places in town and buying all their tea and equipment to keep for herself. Local residents have been struggling due to the shortage of boba, unable to even make their own to get their daily fix. State officials were able to seize the means of production and redistribute all the boba after putting Lucy in her place. We sentence this usurper to work in the boba factories.
