After a week of dark and sunless nights, the cause has been traced to Solar Cell Danielle. She had stolen the sun out of the sky somehow and locked it in her basement, where she used it to supply her solar cells with energy. Danielle had been using this electrical energy in order to produce an artificial sun so she could keep the real one for herself and replace it before anyone noticed, but was caught before she could. We sentence this deceiver to a day on the moon.
