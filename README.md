* Cell block of everyone in their cells

## Personal Pages
Each personal page will include the following:
* image of the cell
* a criminal report of the person
* appreciation notes

## Game Page
Jailbreak: run a specific distance to get out of jail.
* completing the game changes the state of the cells (optional)

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository (make sure you have permissions to modify!)

* Remember to set remote and upstream
* Don't merge directly to master, make a pull request from your branch to master
* Check out Vue.js if you aren't familiar with it
