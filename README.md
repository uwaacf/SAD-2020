# SAD-2020

## Getting Started
* Clone the repository (make sure you have permissions to modify!)
* Make a branch for yourself that has your name in it (use `git checkout -b YOUR_NAME_HERE`)
* Remember to set remote and upstream
* Don't merge directly to master, make a pull request from your branch to master
* Check out Vue.js if you aren't familiar with it
