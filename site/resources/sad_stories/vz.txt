The cityâ€™s rivers are full of coffee-smelling fecal matter thanks to Aromatic Diarrhea Vivia. She was a worker at the local Starbucks, easily becoming the most renowned and like barista in a matter of months due to the delicious coffee she always served. Because her coffee was so enjoyable, people got multiple Trenta cups every day, leading to an influx of diarrhea among citizens. In order to stop the pollution of our water, Vivia has been put behind bars. We sentence this drug lord to a meal at Taco Bell.
