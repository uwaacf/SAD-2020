Curious George Huang was playing with his Ice Bear stuffed animal one fine Sunday morning when disaster struck. Out of nowhere, Speedy Plushie Sammi snatched Ice Bear right out of his hands and ran off. Luckily, she tripped on a block of cheese, sending Ice Bear tumbling back into Georgeâ€™s arms. Our beloved duo were reunited while the boys in blue were able to catch up to her and put her in her place. We sentence this villain to a 5 minute timeout.
