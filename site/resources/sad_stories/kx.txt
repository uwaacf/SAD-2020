Local residents were quite offended when Giggly Laugh Kath couldnâ€™t stop guffawing at her sister being arrested. They all agreed that she should also be incarcerated for her poor timing as well as her history with laughing out of place. The libraries, hospitals, and morgues have never had a normal day ever since Kath showed up. Finally locked away, peace has been restored and people can enjoy their days in quiet. The prison guards, however, report that she is still laughing in prison at this very moment. We sentence this wrongdoer to bolster the confidence of comedians.
