Observant fans from last night’s BTS concert have discovered that it was not Kim “V” Tae-Hyung performing, but rather Subtle Wannabe V. Despite her convincing performance and name, loyal members of the BTS Army sought through her disguise and foiled her plans of replacing Tae-Hyung. Shortly after, he was found locked inside a backstage room. After being exposed, V was promptly brought to justice along with her accomplice, Crafty Kingpin Susan. We sentence this trickster to a mandatory concert by the superior Kim Taeyeon.
