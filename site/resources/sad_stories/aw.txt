Death Valley Ally was taken into custody yesterday after making fun of Death Valley’s name. She couldn’t stop laughing about the Death part of it, offending not only tourists but the valley itself too. Before any more mockery could occur, a crowd threw Ally onto some train tracks, where a train picked her up and gave her a ride back to Washington so she could be locked up. We sentence this mad lass to a carton of milk.
