South Koreaâ€™s drinkable water supply has finally been fully replenished, taking weeks after Liquid Korea Cinthia was caught extracting it bottle by bottle. During her trip to Korea, she gathered up as many bottles as she could before she returned to the U.S. with all of them. Having been caught by TSA, Cinthia was promptly seized of her water and sent back to America for prison time. We sentence this smuggler to salt water only for a day.
