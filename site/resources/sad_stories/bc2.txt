Artistic Foodie Bethany was thrown in jail for her abundant amount of realistic dessert drawings. Everyone who beheld these masterpieces became famished, longing for a taste and thus eating the paper on which the food was drawn. This caused many paper cuts on many tongues, Bethany herself included. She was arrested in order to ensure everyoneâ€™s safety and preserve the peace. We sentence this malefactor to eat some more paper.
