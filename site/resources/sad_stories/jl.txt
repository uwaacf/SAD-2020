The constables have seized Roaring Voice Joyce for breaking shelter-in-place orders. She ran out of her house and decided to sing in the middle of the storm, louder and louder. She was thrown into the slammer, where she continued to sing. This caused Joyceâ€™s enemies to flee and the prison walls to come falling down, but she was promptly arrested again. We sentence this felon to stand in the storm for the next half hour.
