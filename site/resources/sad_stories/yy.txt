Gowen Hall was found in shambles, decimated by none other than Master Plan Yu-Ann. At the request of Core, she assembled a team and tore it all down. Core wished to return to Smith Hall for Large Group, asking her to bulldoze Gowen so that UW would have to let them return to Smith. Unfortunately, the plan did not work. Core was let off the hook while Yu-Ann was put in chains. We sentence this outlaw to the reconstruction of Gowen.
